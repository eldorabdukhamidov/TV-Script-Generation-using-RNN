## Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation Project From Udacity

## RNN for TV Script Generation

In this project, you can learn to generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. Part of the Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons is used for this project. The Neural Network generates a new ,"fake" TV script, based on patterns it recognizes in this training data.

## Libraries utilized

- **NumPy** - a fundamental package for scientific computing in python
- **Pandas** - an ease-to-use python library for manipulating data structures and performing data analysis
- **Jupyter Notebook** - tool that allows the creation of documents with live code
- **Matplotlib** - a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy.
- **torch** - an open source machine learning library
